# AndroidProjects
GitHub repository for a simple Star Wars Android Project by Kunal Kumar Gupta.

The Android Application helps the user explore the World of Star Wars through the swapi API. You can find more about the API at:
http swapi.co/api/ 

The application is supported by a web dashboard powered by MongoDB and the deployment is done on Heroku. 

You can view the Dashboard at: https://damp-taiga-15825.herokuapp.com/SWDashBoard

The dashboard uses a JSP along with Google Charts to show some insights about application usage such as Total number of searches, 
Most Popular Category and Average API Access Time (milliseconds).

The application sits on top of a RESTful architecture, deployed as a web service on Heroku.

You can checkout the App screens in the repository as well!

Hope you get to explore the World of Star Wars!
